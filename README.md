# Task 4: Feature Encoding & Scaling  
## Dataset: Adult Income Dataset

---

## Objective
To convert categorical features into numerical form and scale numerical features to make the dataset suitable for machine learning models.

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## Key Steps
- Identified numerical and categorical features  
- Applied label encoding where order exists  
- Applied one-hot encoding for nominal categorical features  
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler  
- Compared dataset before and after scaling  
- Saved the final processed dataset  

---

## Outcome
The dataset is fully encoded and scaled, improving model compatibility and performance for machine learning algorithms.
